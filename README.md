# Gesture-Controlled Robot with Arduino, POT-HG, L298 Motor Driver, and DC Motors


## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a gesture-controlled robot simulation using Proteus and Arduino Uno. The robot's movements are controlled by interpreting simulated hand gestures via two potentiometers (POT-HG) in Proteus. It showcases basic concepts of gesture control, PWM motor driving, and microcontroller programming.

## Features
### Gesture-Controlled Movement: 
Simulates hand gestures using potentiometers to navigate.

### Real-time Motor Control: 
PWM signals dynamically control the robotâ€™s motors for smooth operation.

### Forward, Backward, and Turning: 
Adjust movements in all directions based on gesture inputs.

### Simulation-Ready Design: 
Fully modeled in Proteus for virtual testing and debugging.


## Components
### Devices:

### Arduino Uno: 
Processes gesture inputs and controls the motors.

### POT-HG 
Potentiometers: Simulate hand gestures for robot movement.

### X-axis: 
Controls forward/backward motion.

### Y-axis: 
Controls left/right turning.

### L298 Motor Driver: 
Drives the two DC motors based on Arduino PWM signals.

### DC Motors (2):
Represent the robot's left and right wheels.

### Power Source: 
Supplies power to the Arduino and motors.


## Software:
### Arduino IDE: 
To write and upload the code to the Arduino Uno.

### Proteus Design Suite: 
For simulating the robot and its control system.


### Circuit Design

### POT-HG Connections:

POT-HG X: Connect to Arduino A0 for forward/backward control.

POT-HG Y: Connect to Arduino A1 for left/right control.

### L298 Motor Driver Connections:

### Power Pins:

### VCC: Connect to the main power supply (e.g., 9V).

### GND: Connect to Arduino GND.

### Motor Outputs:

### OUT1 and OUT2: Connect to the left motor terminals.

### OUT3 and OUT4: Connect to the right motor terminals.

### Control Pins:

### IN1, IN2: 
Control the left motor direction via Arduino D2 and D3.

### IN3, IN4: 
Control the right motor direction via Arduino D4 and D5.

### Enable Pins:

ENA: Connect to Arduino D9 (PWM for left motor).

ENB: Connect to Arduino D10 (PWM for right motor).

## Software Implementation

### Key Code Functions:

### readPotentiometer(axisPin):

Reads analog values from the potentiometers to determine the gesture direction.

### Movement Functions:

moveForward(): Both motors run forward.

moveBackward(): Both motors run backward.

turnLeft(): Right motor runs forward, left motor stops or runs backward.

turnRight(): Left motor runs forward, right motor stops or runs backward.

stopMotors(): Stops both motors.

### Dynamic Control Logic:

Continuously reads POT-HG values and adjusts motor actions accordingly.

How to Run the Project
